# JenkinDashboard
There is an issue within our company when we all are providing the Jenkins to other teams by making all setup and changes to it.
We want them to run the job but witout their credentials limiting their access such that no one can modify the job or no need to provide any jenkins knowledge.
When ever some task is completed they have to select and click a button which will trigger a start of job in jenkins.

So, here I have created a JenkinsDashboard where it will show all jobs which are available and just by click on their selection they can start the job without
any proir knowledge on jenkins.

Using Python as code base, Django as Framework and Jenkins realted python Lib for creating this Dashboard.
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript for front end creation. This solution made operating the jenkins jobs without any proir knowledge on jenkins.

Steps:
Import all requirements.txt libraries
Setup Django
Run the manage.py file for starting the run and make the service available.
